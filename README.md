# Sphere Swap: an Orbital-based, GENIUS Act Compliant AMM for future with thousands of stablecoins 

Sphere Swap is a cross-chain implementation of an [Orbital-based](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/06/orbital) Automated Market Maker (AMM) that applies the concept of UniswapV3's concentrated liquidity to a type of liquidity pool that can support hundreds of stablecoins. Instead of drawing tick boundaries along a curve (e.g. y = x * k), Sphere Swap draws tick boundaries as "orbits" or "spheres" around the $1.00 price point. 

Sphere Swap also has a compliance layer on top using oracles to pull in stablecoin metadata from [GENIUS Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GENIUS_Act) Compliant stablecoin issuers (e.g. reserve breakdown, KYC compliance, etc).
